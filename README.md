# HardCoder-feriechallenge2021

In this repo there are my solutions to Python coding challenge #feriechallenge2021 organised by HardCoder.  
Each day of winter holidays there was a task to write a Python program.



I used Python 3.9 and following libraries:

* geocoder
* geopy
* Pillow
* pylightxlx
* pyperclip
* requests
* requests-html
